    <h2>A note about Franklin Veaux</h2>
    <h3 class="subtitle">from Yorkshire O.P.E.N organisers Emily &amp; Quinn; Feb 2019</h3>
    <p>Some of you may have heard about the revelations regarding Franklin Veaux, co-author of <em>More than Two</em> and author of <em>The Game Changer</em>. If you haven’t, <a href="https://medium.com/@fv.survivor.pod/on-light-and-shadow-polyamorys-metoo-411e0275c2fe" title="On Light and Shadow: Polyamory’s #metoo">you can read the blog post here</a>.</p>
    <p>In the past we have consistently recommended his books and blog, and we hosted Franklin and his co-author/partner Eve Rickert to speak at an O.P.E.N event in October 2015.</p>
    <p>The blog post lays out the situation very clearly and articulately, so we won’t recap it in too much depth here. We echo its belief and support of survivors. We also acknowledge that we and many in the O.P.E.N community have gained insights and help from Franklin’s work, and those gains need not be erased.</p>
    <p>But now and in future we would advise his work be looked at with a different lens, in light of the revelations about abuse. As stated in the article:</p>
    <blockquote>“Do remain mindful of the fact that his stories about past relationships consistently differ from his past partners’ experiences, to a degree that goes beyond what can be explained by two people remembering the same events differently.”</blockquote>
    <p>We also intend to follow the advice given in the blog post, with regards to booking speakers and promoting the work of “leaders” in the polyamory community.</p>
    <p>As we state at the beginning of every O.P.E.N discussion as part of <nuxt-link to="/what-to-expect#rules">the ground rules</nuxt-link>, “Just because someone is talking a lot doesn’t mean they know what they’re talking about.”</p>
    <p>We are not opening this post to public comments, but if you have any thoughts or questions to share, please <nuxt-link to="/contact">get in touch with us directly</nuxt-link>. We’re happy to discuss it further.</p>
